# Inspiration

Waad was looking for a school for her little sister that has a high reviews and reasonable prices, but this process was tiring especially when she was looking for a way to communicate with the schools and where are these schools located, then Waad thought: why is there no application that includes all schools and institutes in Saudi Arabia and saves time and effort through a single platform?


# What it does
The app is the joining of a group of institutes and schools located in Saudi Arabia, such as: language institutes, international schools,  Quran memorization schools, schools and institutes that support people with special needs, etc. 
The application makes it easy for parents and students to search for what type of education they want, the appropriate prices, and the neighborhood in which the school is located.
Users can register themselves and pay through the application with ease to start their educational journey. The application benefits institutions in marketing and spreading more widely. 
The application is used in the field of e-commerce, such as obtaining a percentage of profits from each student who registered in the application, which is from 5-7% of each registration process.

# How we built it
First, we analyzed the idea, draw a flow chart and sketching some of the interfaces, then we chose the colors and started designing the interfaces using Figma.
The application will be programmed through flutter to be compatible with IOS and Android.

# What's next for the app
1. Design the app to support English language.
2. Add online classes.
3. Add study schedules.
4. Add accounts for parents.
