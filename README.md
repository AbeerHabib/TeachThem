# Problem/Challenge
<p align="justify">
Many parents and students face the challenge of finding the right institution or school, especially with the rise in the number of private schools and institutes in Saudi Arabia. Comparing and evaluating schools that meet their preferences becomes challenging for parents, and there is a lack of easily accessible information about these schools online.
</p>

# App Idea
<p align="justify">
The app brings together a variety of institutes and schools located in Saudi Arabia, including language institutes, international schools, Quran memorization schools, and institutions that support individuals with special needs. Its main purpose is to assist students and trainees in searching for, registering at, and paying fees for private institutes and schools.
</br>
For students and trainees, the app streamlines the enrollment process by providing a centralized platform for searching and registering at various educational institutions.
</br>
For educational institutions, the app simplifies the registration and admission processes for students. Institutions can showcase their information, including images, registration fees, and other relevant details.
</br>
The app operates within the e-commerce domain and generates revenue by earning a percentage of the profits from each student registration. This percentage typically ranges from 5% to 7% of the registration fees.
